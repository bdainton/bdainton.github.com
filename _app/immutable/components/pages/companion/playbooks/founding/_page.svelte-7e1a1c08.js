      First and foremost, I think it's important to establish a set of <b
        >shared beliefs to act as guideposts for the team's decisions</b

      <a href='reference/principles-and-practices#principle-simpler' target='_blank'

      to fuel our rapid efforts to find and secure product-market fit.

      As I recruit our first few developers, I also set the expectation that -- with each other -- we will

        >vocal, helpful, dependable, and kind.</a>
    </p>

      <p>The dev team has <b>no real structure</b> at this time. It's composed of mostly-senior talent that came in via my personal network (trusted folks I've worked with in the past).

    organization has evolved into the `),we=n($,"A",{href:!0});var za=o(we);ra=s(za,"Growing Phase"),za.forEach(t),oa=s($,`. I
    ask myself these questions:
    `),g=n($,"UL",{});var k=o(g);qe=n(k,"LI",{});var Ja=o(qe);ia=s(Ja,"- Do we have a product idea with real customer traction?"),Ja.forEach(t),sa=h(k),Ge=n(k,"LI",{});var Ua=o(Ge);la=s(Ua,`- Do I feel the need to expand the team beyond a single set of developers to deliver on this
        product idea?`),Ua.forEach(t),ca=h(k),Se=n(k,"LI",{});var Ka=o(Se);ha=s(Ka,"- Am I getting pressure to deliver more product faster?"),Ka.forEach(t),da=h(k),Oe=n(k,"LI",{});var Qa=o(Oe);pa=s(Qa,`- Am I spending significant time thinking about effective hiring and onboarding, and less
        time thinking about building product?`),Qa.forEach(t),ma=h(k),Fe=n(k,"LI",{});var Ya=o(Fe);ua=s(Ya,"- Am I getting pressure to help compose and communicate a product roadmap?"),Ya.forEach(t),k.forEach(t),fa=s($,`

    If the answer is yes to two or more of these questions, then that tells me we've shifted into
    the
