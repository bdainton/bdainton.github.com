      First and foremost, I think it's important to establish a set of <b

      As I recruit our first few developers, I also set the expectation that -- with each other -- we will

      <p>The dev team has <b>no real structure</b> at this time. It's composed of mostly-senior talent that came in via my personal network (trusted folks I've worked with in the past).

    I ask myself these questions:
    `),g=n($,"UL",{});var k=o(g);Ve=n(k,"LI",{});var Ra=o(Ve);na=s(Ra,"- Do we have a product idea with real customer traction?"),Ra.forEach(t),ra=h(k),qe=n(k,"LI",{});var Ba=o(qe);oa=s(Ba,`- Do I feel the need to expand the team beyond a single set of developers to deliver on this
        product idea?`),Ba.forEach(t),ia=h(k),Ge=n(k,"LI",{});var Ha=o(Ge);sa=s(Ha,"- Am I getting pressure to deliver more product faster?"),Ha.forEach(t),la=h(k),Se=n(k,"LI",{});var za=o(Se);ca=s(za,`- Am I spending significant time thinking about effective hiring and onboarding, and less
        time thinking about building product?`),za.forEach(t),ha=h(k),Oe=n(k,"LI",{});var Ja=o(Oe);da=s(Ja,"- Am I getting pressure to help compose and communicate a product roadmap?"),Ja.forEach(t),k.forEach(t),pa=s($,`

    If the answer is yes to two or more of these questions, then that tells me we've shifted into
    the
